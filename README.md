Object Identification using Spring Boot & Gemini API

An AI-powered Object Identification System built with Spring Boot and integrated with Google Gemini API to analyze and identify objects from uploaded images.
This project demonstrates how to integrate AI vision capabilities into a Java-based backend for smart image recognition.

🚀 Overview

This application allows users to:

Upload an image through a web interface or REST API.

Automatically detect and describe objects using Gemini Vision API.

Return structured data (object names, descriptions, confidence scores, etc.).

Display results neatly on the frontend.

🧩 Features

✅ Upload images for AI-based object detection
✅ Use Google Gemini API for object identification
✅ RESTful API endpoints for integration
✅ JSON response with object details
✅ Easy-to-deploy Spring Boot architecture
✅ Handles multiple image formats (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)
✅ Supports both frontend UI and API-based use
